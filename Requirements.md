**Group Projects and Presentation**
**CS225**

Demonstrate your knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming in a Group Project. You must use C++ unless you receive instructor approval. Project topics must receive approval.

**C++ Program and Style Guide (80%)**

Your finished project should demonstrate the following concepts we learned in class:

- thoughtful selection of variable names, function names, and class names.
- division of code into multiple header and source code files
- if statements
- while, do-while, and for loops
- functions
- class definitions
- constructors and destructors
- operator overloading
- object composition
- inheritance
- exceptions
- file I/O
- a UML diagram
- demonstration of a C++ command/function/concept that we have not covered in class yet
- good programming practices

Submit a style guide and made sure to follow it with all your submitted code. (In class we talked about Google&#39;s coding guidelines: [https://](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)[google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) Your Style Guide doesn&#39;t have to be nearly this extensive)

If you submit someone else&#39;s code as your own without give them credit, this is academic misconduct and you will receive a zero on the project.

The project should demonstrate your object oriented programming knowledge from the whole semester and the project should be complex/comprehensive enough to warrant a multiple week project. (if you turn in only a few lines of code or something that doesn&#39;t look like you spend more than an hour on it, don&#39;t expect to get full credit)

**Presentation (20%)**** **
Create a PowerPoint (or other graphical) presentation that is aimed at your target audience (our class).

- 3-5 minutes long.  Presentations will take place during class time.  Correctly use C++ vocabulary words during your presentation (ex. virtual function, abstract base class, overloading, overriding, scope resolution operator).
- Be an attentive listener during all of your classmates&#39; presentations.
