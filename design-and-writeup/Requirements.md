**Group Projects and Presentation**
**CS225**

Demonstrate your knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming in a Group Project. You must use C++ unless you receive instructor approval. Project topics must receive approval.

**C++ Program and Style Guide (80%)**

Your finished project should demonstrate the following concepts we learned in class:

- thoughtful selection of variable names, function names, and class names.
- division of code into multiple header and source code files
- [if statements](https://github.com/wagyourtail/battleship-cpp/blob/main/src/client/wagyourgui/DrawableHelper.cpp#L13)
- [while](https://github.com/wagyourtail/battleship-cpp/blob/main/src/client/wagyourgui/GLFWSession.cpp#L60), [do-while](https://github.com/wagyourtail/battleship-cpp/blob/main/src/client/battleship/player/BsBotOpponent.cpp#L22), and [for loops](https://github.com/wagyourtail/battleship-cpp/blob/main/src/client/battleship/player/BsBotOpponent.cpp#L9)
- [functions](https://github.com/wagyourtail/battleship-cpp/blob/main/src/client/wagyourgui/DrawableHelper.cpp#L12)
- [class definitions](https://github.com/wagyourtail/battleship-cpp/blob/main/src/client/battleship/GameStateMachine.h)
- [constructors and destructors](https://github.com/wagyourtail/battleship-cpp/blob/main/src/shared/SocketConnection.h#L16)
- [operator overloading](https://github.com/wagyourtail/battleship-cpp/blob/main/src/shared/SocketConnection.h#L28)
- [object composition](https://github.com/wagyourtail/battleship-cpp/blob/main/src/client/battleship/GameStateMachine.h#L27)
- [inheritance](https://github.com/wagyourtail/battleship-cpp/blob/main/src/client/wagyourgui/elements/Button.h#L15)
- [exceptions](https://github.com/wagyourtail/battleship-cpp/blob/main/src/client/wagyourgui/Font.cpp#L22)
- [file I/O](https://github.com/wagyourtail/battleship-cpp/blob/main/src/client/wagyourgui/Font.cpp#L11)
- [a UML diagram](https://github.com/wagyourtail/battleship-cpp/blob/main/design-and-writeup/uml-diagram.png) - it's a bit big to display in git
- demonstration of a C++ command/function/concept that we have not covered in class yet - [mutex](https://github.com/wagyourtail/battleship-cpp/blob/main/src/client/battleship/player/RemoteOpponent.h#L22) [shared_ptr/unique_ptr](https://github.com/wagyourtail/battleship-cpp/blob/main/src/client/battleship/player/RemoteOpponent.h#L17) [thread](https://github.com/wagyourtail/battleship-cpp/blob/main/src/server/Session.cpp#L29) [c11 random](https://github.com/wagyourtail/battleship-cpp/blob/main/src/server/Session.cpp#L22)
- good programming practices

Submit a style guide and made sure to follow it with all your submitted code. (In class we talked about Google&#39;s coding guidelines: [https://](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)[google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) Your Style Guide doesn&#39;t have to be nearly this extensive)

If you submit someone else&#39;s code as your own without give them credit, this is academic misconduct and you will receive a zero on the project.

The project should demonstrate your object oriented programming knowledge from the whole semester and the project should be complex/comprehensive enough to warrant a multiple week project. (if you turn in only a few lines of code or something that doesn&#39;t look like you spend more than an hour on it, don&#39;t expect to get full credit)

**Presentation (20%)**** **
Create a PowerPoint (or other graphical) presentation that is aimed at your target audience (our class).

- 3-5 minutes long.  Presentations will take place during class time.  Correctly use C++ vocabulary words during your presentation (ex. virtual function, abstract base class, overloading, overriding, scope resolution operator).
- Be an attentive listener during all of your classmates&#39; presentations.
